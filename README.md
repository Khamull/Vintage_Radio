# Vintage_Radio
I'm creating a vintage Radio Using a Raspberry Pi 3B that will fit in to my 1965 VW Bus, sice it have a very specific form, I decided to take advantage of rotary encoders and slowly add, besides the normal functions of a radio, some sensors for temperature and whell rotation, everything nicely package with a Oled Display.
