# Vintage_Radio
I'm creating a vintage Radio Using a Raspberry Pi 3B that will fit in to my 1965 VW Bus, since it have a very specific form, I decided to take advantage of rotary encoders and slowly add, besides the normal functions of a radio & bluetooth, some sensors for temperature and whell rotation for tire pressure, everything nicely package with a OlED Display.

So Far I have the bluetooth trought Pulse Audio and Blues, and some code for getting the info of the current media playing and some triall and error with volumes and ALSA controls.
